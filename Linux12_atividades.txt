#Challeng 1

1.Suppose you connect frequently to a server located in a remote data center by running: ssh -l u123h -p 9956 191.169.0.1
  Create an alias named main for the command and make it persistent after reboot.

	- vim ~/.bashre    'adc na ultima linha cmd abaixo'
	- alias comandoip='ssh -l micael -p 2226 192.168.1.146


#Challenge 2

1.Create a Bash script named script1.sh. Add the shebang.
  Define a variable called country that holds the country you are living in.
  Print the message: You live in YOUR_COUNTRY.
  Run the script in different ways.

	- vim script1.sh
	- #!/bin/bahs
	  coutry='Italy'
	  echo 'You live in $coutry'
	- ./script1
	- source script1


#Challenge 3

1.Create a script and define two string variables.
  Add a commented line after the shebang and another inline comment.
  Create a new variable by concatenating the two string variables.
  Run the script.

	- vim script2.sh
		#!/bin/bash
		#Declarando primeira string
		str1="Hello"
		#Declarando segunda string
		str2="World of Linux."
		nw="$str1 $str2"
		echo "$nw"
	-./script2.sh


#Challenge 4

1.Develop a Bash script that creates a new group and a new username. The group will be the user’s secondary group.
  The username and the group will be given as input by the user that runs the script.
  The script will also display the last 2 lines from the files where the users and the groups are saved in Linux.
  Test the script by running it as root.
	
	- vim script3.sh
		-#!/bin/bash
		#Automatizando a criação de usuario e grupo
		read -p "Name of the user: " username
		read -p "Name of the group: " groupname
		sudo useradd -m -d /home/"$username" "$username"
		sleep 1
		sudo groupadd "$groupname"
		sudo usermod -aG "$groupadd" "$username"
		sleep 1
		tail -n 2 /etc/passwd
		echo #################
		tail -n 2 /etc/group


#Challenge 5

1.Create a script called fix_permissions.sh that prompts the user for a directory and 
  changes the permissions of all subdirectories to 755 and to all files to 644 recursively.

	- vim script4.sh
		-#!/bin/bash
		#Atutomatizando permissões para file e directory
		read -p "Enter name directory :" dir
		ehco -n "Changing files permissions to 664 recursively..."
		fid $dir -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
		echo "Done."

		echo -n "Changing subdirectories permissions to 755 recursively..."
		fid $dir -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
		ehco "Done"
